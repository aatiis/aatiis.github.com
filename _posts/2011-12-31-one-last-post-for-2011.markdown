Here's a list of things that has happened with me this year.

Among other things, I got married, found out I'm soon to be a dad, moved back
to my home town, opened a company, __almost__ beat [John][5] in go-kart,
visited Luxembourg, The Netherlands (&times;2), Austria (&times;2), Belgium,
__almost__ visited [Italy][1], started renewing my new home, adopted three
dogs, and held a garden party where three bands were playing in our garage.

At [Vemble][2], we visited a [Startup Weekend][4], ported the app to [Sencha
Touch 2][3], released a beta version, and we finally found a new team member
who is likely to stay with us.

I only have one wish for 2012 (or at least for the period while the world [still
exists][6]): that next time I'm writing a post like this, I don't have to type
__almost__ one single time.

That includes go-kart. Beckett, be prepared.
