Here's a couple of things you should know when using a word processor. Although
most people seem to already know this, some might not, so I felt the need to
help those by posting this tutorial.

Follow these easy step to make your life easier. You do this, everyone will
admire you, for they will see you're a professional when they take their first
glance at your work!


First and most important: file formats
--------------------------------------

By all means, use a **proprietary format**. `.docx` is preferable. `.doc` and
`.rtf` are good as well, if your shitty word processor doesn't support `.docx`.
If you save your document in an older format, other people who have older
office versions might have trouble opening them (although it is very rare
today, as studies show that 99.9999% of people have the latest version of MS
Office installed with all the updates applied).

Remember to never, ever use an **open standard**, like
[`.odt`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument). Why the hell would you?
Those things are for sissies.

If your word processor gives you a choice of multiple **encodings**, use
something like **CP-1252** or **ISO-8859-1**. Avoid using **UTF-8** at all
costs.

Also, when sending your document for printing, the most important thing is not
to export it in
[`.pdf`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format), because
**PDF** will look different on all computers, depending on the operating
system, the user's skin colour and the current humidity just outside the
building.  [`.xps`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_XML_Paper_Specification)
and [`.ps`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript) are also discouraged for
printing.

To make you look very professional, try to export your files in an exotic
format, for example `.cdr`.

Also, if you write many similar documents, it is usually okay to have a
**template**, as long as you don't save it in one of the template formats. If
you do so, you won't be able to open it again. Template formats are for
completely different reasons anyway.


Formatting
----------

This is what most people get wrong. However, if you follow these few
guidelines, you won't have any trouble with your documents.

* To move something to the next page, hit enter a couple of times, it will add
  a **page break**. (Never press Ctrl+Enter, that will crash your word
  processor!)
* If you need to **center-align** or **right-align** something, just add spaces
  before.
* Never use more than one **defined style** in a document. If you need
  different-looking text, apply the styles explicitly. Especially for headers -
  just make them nice and big and bold.
* Also, paragraphs might need some **padding**, so you'll need to add extra
  lines before and after them.
* If you need a **line**, the correct way to do it is to add bunch of
  underscores (`_`) and position them using spaces.
* The above rule also works if you want to **underline** a big heading: just
  add underscores to the next line after the heading.
* Since **footnotes** are usually not supported, add the superscripts yourself
  and then add the footnote text to the bottom of the page.
* **Headers and footers** are not supported by most word processors either,
  emphasising that you shouldn't use them even if they are supported.
* Also don't use **special fields** like formulas or date fields. It's always
  best practice to use plain text for everything, because that is easier to
  style.
* When **pasting** text from the web, always chose to paste the styles as well
  and not just the text. You want your pasted text to look pretty, right?
* A good practice is to **insert images of text blocks** captured from other
  sources using the print-screen button that is available on the newest
  computers manufactured after 2010.
* To **CAPITALISE** a piece of text (useful to do that with all headings),
  press the `Caps Lock` button (which you should use as much as possible
  anyway), and type your text like that.


Power tips
----------

These are the secret tips that only hackers and power users know.

* For the love of [God](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster)
  don't ever use **automatic page numbers**. Those things will not update
  correctly, and some will not even print. Add your page numbers manually.
* Same thing applies for **table of contents**. If you need one, restrain from
  using the built-in TOC, as that will never update correctly. The best is to
  add your table of contents manually, using lots of dots to right-align the
  page number.
* Never set the **language of the text** you write - most word processors don't
  have support for this anyway.
* Never use the **built-in hyphenation** - especially not together with
  **justified text** (by the way, you always want to justify your paragraphs,
  especially for web publishing!)
* Don't use **sections**. They're only useful if you use headers/footers or
  page numbers, which you shouldn't use anyway. If you want different page
  numbers for part of the document, you should save that part as a separate
  file.
* **Numbering** is best done when the numbers are inserted manually. Beware
  that some word processors will convert those automatically to numbered lists.
  You probably want to disable that option.
* To **replace multiple occurrences** of some text, press the `Binoculars`
  button, search for the text you want to replace, move the cursor to the end
  of the highlighted text, delete it using `backspace` key, type in the correct
  text, and repeat these steps for all occurrences.
* Using **keyboard shortcuts** will make you look stupid.


Printing
--------

It's very important to always print your documents. Printing is good for the
environment as your printer will consume CO<sub>2</sub> when you print, thus
helping trees to grow, as CO<sub>2</sub> prevents tree growth.

If for some reason you can't print your document, you should burn it to a CD.

You need to remember a few things when printing a document though:

* Don't enable **non-printing characters**, that will make them appear on the
  print.
* Never use the built-in **spell checker**, because the curly red lines below
  certain words will appear on print.
* Never use **tables**! The borders will show up on the print even if you
  completely disable them!
* Don't use the **non-breaking space** (Ctrl+Shift+Space) as it will appear as
  small circle when printing.
* Same goes for the **non-breaking hyphen** (Ctrl+Shift+Hyphen) - how could a
  hyphen be non-breaking anyway?!
* Try not to change the **margins**, but if you really need to change them, set
  them to **0**, that will work best with most printers.
* If you have enabled **headers** or **footers** (which must have been a
  mistake), don't use separate styles for odd/even pages. Most likely all your
  pages are odd, so this option wouldn't work anyway.
* Never print **odd/even pages** separately, for the same reason as stated
  above.  If you, for some stupid reason, want to print on both sides of the
  paper, feed the pares to the printer one-by-one, giving it back the pages so
  it could print on the other side as well.
* The **Print Preview** button is rarely useful, don't bother clicking it, as
  it will send your document to the printer for a review. Unless you have one
  of those expensive printers with print preview support, this option is
  useless for you.
* Beware that coloured text will **break black-and-white printers**.
* Finally, never use a **serif font** for printing. Serifs are illegal to print
  in most countries.

It's worth noting that some word processors will insert special characters when
you type, without even asking you. This bug is known as the **auto correct
bug**.  If you find characters that have been inserted by this bug, don't
forget to revert them to what you originally wanted to type, because by all
means, that must have been correct.

Some of the most common symptoms of this bug is replacing three dots with a
so-called ellipsis character, or minus signs with en-dashes. These special
characters are for scientific use only, so you should always revert them to
what you have originally typed.

Unfortunately the auto correct bug cannot be disabled or configured.


Style guide
-----------

Knowing how to use your word processor is not enough if you don't know how to
make it pretty. Follow these easy tips and your documents will look
extra-professional. Think the magic touch!

* Most important style guide is to always use [**Comic
  Sans**](http://bancomicsans.com/) for text that will appear on public places,
  especially for the front page. Do not use common fonts like Arial &ndash;
  those will not show up on other people's computers or may not display special
  characters (like the ones used in the Country of Europe).
* Remember to use **more than one font**. The more fonts you use, the more
  professional you'll look. Who likes to read boring, same-looking paragraphs
  anyway?
* For a special touch, try setting the **children/orphan options** to a very small
  number. That way your reader will easily keep reading your paragraphs without
  thinking that there's no more of them because of the blank space at the end
  of a page.


Grammar
-------

This is the least important thing in a document, thus I mention it at the end.
If your document looks good, you probably don't need to worry about grammar
anyway.

To use grammar, click `File -> Advanced Options -> Enable Grammar`.
Congratulations, now your document uses grammar! (Note that most schools will
require you to disable this option for essays. Some might even ban you for the
use of grammar in texts, as it is considered cheating.)

Beside enabling grammar, you should check your text for fine details. For
example, check if you have accidentally added a space after a full stop or a
comma (which is the most common mistake).

To make your essay has a more "international feeling", make sure to use both
British and American English (also known as Real English). The easiest way to
do so is by pasting from various web sites.

A note for non-English users: always keep your language set to English, that
will help you correct most grammatical mistakes, like capitalising the letter
*i* (which is Serbian for "*and*").

More information on grammar can be found on [The Oatmeal's
website](http://theoatmeal.com/tag/grammar).


Final conclusion
----------------

If you find it hard to remember these rules, don't worry. Word processors are
designed for experts with a very high IQ and years of training. If you don't
know how to use a feature, that's because it is extremely complex and
non-documented, so only the creators of the word processors themselves know how
to use them.

The best thing to do when you need extremely sophisticated features like
vertically aligned text or changing paper size is to ask a programmer. Computer
programmers work with MS Word all the time, because they use that to write
computer programs like Internet, Facebook and FarmVille. That is why they will
be more than happy to help you out with creating, formatting, or printing
documents. Also they will write them and translate them if you ask nicely.

That all said, if you dare ask me to edit one more document again. Just one
more document. I will use your own worthless computer to beat you beyond
recognition and then feed you to my dogs.
