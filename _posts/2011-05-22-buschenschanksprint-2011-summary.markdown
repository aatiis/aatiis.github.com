I'm happy to announce that my lovely girlfriend and I have attended the first
four days of
[Buschenschanksprint
2011](http://www.coactivate.org/projects/buschenschanksprint-2011), in the
beautiful hills and vineyards of
[Berghausen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berghausen,_Austria), in
[Styria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styria),
[Austria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria). We had some great time,
visited some [Buschensch√§nke](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buschenschank), and,
of course, wrote & fixed a bunch of code.

As for myself, I was greedy enough to only work on code that is currently
related to the project I'm working on. Nevertheless, during the sprint we've
implemented a new library, a [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) connector for the
[YAFOWIL](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/yafowil) form/widget library, called
[yafowil.yaml](https://github.com/bluedynamics/yafowil.yaml). I also
contributed a patch to
[rod.recipe.appengine](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/rod.recipe.appengine), so
now there's a new release [on
PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/rod.recipe.appengine).

We've also fixed a few small bugs in
[cone.app](https://github.com/bluedynamics/cone.app) and
[cone.tile](https://github.com/bluedynamics/cone.tile), AnneGilles and rnix has
improved the documentation/tutorial, Gogo has done work on the
[agx](http://agx.me/) stack, and AnneGilles showed us a tutorial on their new
[S3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3)-compliant database.
