summary: "A short summary about the work done by the participants of the
a][rtsprinters in Vienna."

In a nutshell, the
[artsprint](http://www.coactivate.org/projects/artsprint2011) was a one-week
[Python](http://www.python.org/)
- [Pyramid](http://docs.pylonsproject.org/) -
  [Node](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/node) sprint at the ]a[ academy of fine
  arts, Vienna. Participants were mostly [BDA](http://bluedynamics.com/)
  people, with the addition of other Python enthusiasts. We've been working on
  a stack of libraries that most of use on a daily basis, focusing mainly on
  writing documentation, fixing tests, and converting the whole stack from
  `repoze.bfg` to Pyramid.

</div>

As a result, we:

 * released `Plumber` 1.0 (an alternative to mixin-based extension of classes)
 * updated `Node`, `Yafowil` (and its widget libraries) and `cone.*` to `Pyramid`
 * improved the documentation of the stack
 * set up a [buildbot](http://trac.buildbot.net/) to run periodical & on-demand
   unit-tests and code checks
 * worked on `agx`
 * had some productive discussions
 * met new friends & did some key signings
 * spent some quality time at the [Metalab](http://metalab.at/)
 * had loads of fun in Vienna!

And we even had a [button
machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin-back_button).
