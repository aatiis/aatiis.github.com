Today is the first day of the [2010 Neoplanta
Sprint](http://www.coactivate.org/projects/neoplanta-sprint) in [Novi
Sad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novi_Sad),
[Serbia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia). Now I'm not really an expert in
[Plone](http://plone.org/), but I have had some experience with [Zope
3](http://www.zope.org/Products/Zope3), and since the sprint is taking place in
my favorite Serbian city, I decided to take part.

The event is taking place at [Hotel
Putnik](http://www.google.com/search?q=hotel+putnik+novi+sad), which is in the
city center. I'm arriving today afternoon, about 5pm. Looking forward to meet
new people there.
