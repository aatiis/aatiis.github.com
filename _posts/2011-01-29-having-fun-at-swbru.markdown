The Slartup Weekend seems great so far. We're running surveys, andvertizing,
planning, playing the [Kinect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect), drinking
beer, eating [mandarins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_orange), meeting
interesting people, and planning cow usage. So far not much coding though. I'll
just have to make it up next week at
[artsprint](http://www.coactivate.org/projects/artsprint2011).
