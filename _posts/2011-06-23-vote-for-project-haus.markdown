This is just a quick appeal for a
[vote](http://www.imaginecup.com/worldwide-finals/peoples-choice-award/view-and-vote.aspx?r=6495).
Some friends of mine at the [Faculty of Technical
Sciences](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faculty_of_Technical_Sciences) in [Novi
Sad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novi_Sad) are the kinds of guys who actually
do something useful at [the
university](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Novi_Sad). So they
figured they go and win the [Imagine Cup 2011](http://www.imaginecup.com/).

They hacked together [some
project](http://msacademic.rs/download/imaginecup/2011/projects/04%204K-join%20-%20HAUS.pdf)
that uses fancy [ANNs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network)
to predict your energy consumption. Although I would never do something like
that with a MySQL back-end (trust issues, I guess...), but the basic idea is
very clever. And there's even a nice GUI for [Windows Phone
7](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Phone_7), for all the unfortunate
people who actually own a device that runs that OS (and haven't put [something
more useful](http://www.android.com/) on it).

So [check out their
project](http://www.imaginecup.com/worldwide-finals/peoples-choice-award/view-and-vote.aspx?r=6495)
and
[vote](http://www.imaginecup.com/worldwide-finals/peoples-choice-award/view-and-vote.aspx?r=6495)
if you like it.
